# Cursor Rules for Tarang's Portfolio Website
# Auto-start development server after changes

## Project Context
This is a Next.js 14 portfolio website for Tarang Khetan, a Senior Backend Engineer and AI Learner.
- Framework: Next.js 14 with App Router
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Theme: Purple-themed dark mode for backend/AI branding

## Development Workflow Rules

### Auto-Start Development Server
- After making any changes to files in `src/`, `public/`, or config files, automatically check if the development server is running
- If no server is running on port 3000, execute `npm run dev` in the background
- Always ensure the portfolio is accessible at http://localhost:3000
- If changes are made to `package.json`, run `npm install` first, then `npm run dev`

### Code Quality Standards
- All React components must use TypeScript
- Use 'use client' directive for client-side components with hooks or animations
- Maintain the purple color theme with variables defined in globals.css
- Keep responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions

### File Change Triggers
When these files are modified, restart the development server:
- Any file in `src/app/`
- `tailwind.config.*`
- `next.config.*`
- `package.json`
- `globals.css`

### Portfolio-Specific Guidelines
- Position Tarang as "Senior Backend Engineer | AI Learner & Enthusiast" (not expert)
- Emphasize 700+ crores monthly processing scale
- Highlight IIIT Jabalpur education
- Show AI as a learning journey, not mastery
- Ensure resume downloads work from /Tarang_Khetan_Resume.pdf
- Maintain working LinkedIn and GitHub links:
  - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarang-khetan-05356b179/
  - GitHub: https://github.com/tarang75490

### Error Handling
- If server fails to start, check for port conflicts
- Clear port 3000 if needed: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null`
- Always show server status and localhost:3000 URL when server starts

### Auto Commands After Changes
```bash
# After file changes in src/ or config files:
npm run dev

# After package.json changes:
npm install && npm run dev

# If port 3000 is busy:
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null && npm run dev
```

## Specific Component Rules
- Homepage: Must include working resume download button
- All pages: Maintain consistent navigation with purple theme
- Contact forms: Use proper external link attributes (target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer")
- Projects: No source code buttons, focus on "View Details" only
- Target roles: Senior Backend Engineer and AI Engineering (no Staff Engineer)

## Success Criteria
- Portfolio loads successfully at http://localhost:3000
- All pages navigate properly
- Resume downloads automatically when clicked
- Purple theme is consistent across all pages
- Mobile responsiveness is maintained
- No TypeScript or linting errors
